# Hate-speech
Hate speech detection is the task of detecting if communication such as text, audio, and so on contains hatred and or encourages violence towards a person or a group of people. This is usually based on prejudice against 'protected characteristics' such as their ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age et al. Models can be evaluated with metrics like the F-score or F-measure.
Python libraries make it very easy for us to handle the data and perform typical and complex tasks with a single line of code.

Pandas – This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format and has multiple functions to perform analysis tasks in one go.
Numpy – Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations in a very short time.
